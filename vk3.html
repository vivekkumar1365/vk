<h3>HIP HOP</H3>
<P>Hip hop music, also called hip-hop[3][4] or rap music,[4][5][6] is a music 
genre developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s
 which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping,
 a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.[4] It developed as part of hip h
 op culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping,
 DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing.[7][8][9] O
 ther elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats 
 nd sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer s
 olely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes 14]

<h3>SALSA</h3>
<p>
The name salsa (sauce) has been described as a dance since the mid-1970s. The use of the term for the dance started in New York. It evolved from earlier Cuban dance forms such as Son, Son Montuno, cha cha cha, mambo and Puerto Rican bomba and plena which were popular in the Caribbean, Latin America and the Latino communities in New York since the 1940s. Salsa, like most music genres has gone through a lot of variation through the years and incorporated elements of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Caribbean dances such as Guaguancó and Pachanga. Different countries of the Caribbean and Latin America have distinct salsa styles of their own, such as Cuban, Cali Colombia, Puerto Rican, L.A. and New York styles.
There is some controversy surrounding the origins of the word "salsa". Some claim that it was based on a cry shouted by musicians while they were playing their music. Others believe that the term was created by record labels to better market their music, who chose the word "salsa" because of its spicy and hot connotations. Still others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles, just like salsa or "sauce" in Latin American countries is a mixture of different ingredients.

<h3>SLOW MOTION</H3>
<P>
The first detailed European record of Khôn and other Thai classical dances was made during the Ayutthaya Kingdom showing the tradition and styles of dramatic art which were almost identical to the Thai traditions we still see today. Historical evidence clearly establishes that the Thai art of stage plays must have already been perfected by the 17th Century. Louis XIV, the Sun King of France, had a formal diplomatic relation with Ayutthaya’s King Narai. In 1687, France sent the diplomat Simon de la Loubère to record all that he saw in the Siamese Kingdom and its traditions. In his famous account “Du Royaume de Siam”, La Loubère carefully observed the classic 17th-century theatre of Siam, including an epic battle scene from a Khon performance, and recorded what he saw in great details:
“The Siamese have three sorts of Stage Plays: That which they call Cone [Khôn] is a figure dance, to the sound of the violin and some other instruments. The dancers are masked and armed, and represent rather a combat than a dance. And though every one runs into high motions, and extravagant postures, they cease not continually to intermix some word. Most of their masks are hideous, and represent either monstrous Beasts, or kinds of Devils. The Show which they call Lacone is a poem intermix with Epic and Dramatic, which lasts three days, from eight in the morning till seven at night. They are histories in verse, serious, and sung by several actors always present, and which do only sing reciprocally …. The Rabam is a double dance of men and women, which is not martial, but gallant … they can perform it without much tying themselves, because their way of dancing is a simple march round, very slow, and without any high motion; but with a great many slow contortions of the body and arms.”[1
